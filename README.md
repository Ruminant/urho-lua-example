# urho-lua-example

A very simple lua project for urho3d.  As basic as it gets...

You need to have Urho3d installed, and the environment variable URHO3D_HOME set.

Running `run_example.bat` simply calls the urho3dplayer, passing the the name of our test lua script (in windowed mode).  Pressing `ESCAPE` will quit.
